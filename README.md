### Future Implementations

#### Multiple Languages

To make the site accessible to a broader audience, I plan to implement multi-language support, particularly for international tourists. This will allow users to navigate the site and make bookings in their preferred language, enhancing the overall user experience.

#### Customer Ratings and Reviews
A feedback system will be introduced where customers can rate their experience after their boat trip. This feature will not only help future customers make informed decisions but also provide valuable insights for improving service quality.

#### Waitlist Feature
To prevent potential customers from being turned away due to fully booked slots, a waitlist feature will be added. Customers can join the waitlist for specific time slots and receive automatic notifications if a spot becomes available.

#### Adding More Boats
To scale the business and accommodate more customers, I plan to add additional boats to the fleet. This will allow for greater flexibility in booking and help meet the growing demand as the restaurant gains popularity.

### Screen Reader Compatibility

#### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Create an env.py file in the project directory. Add environment variables for:
 * DATABASE_URL
 * SECRET_KEY
 * EMAIL_HOST_USER
 * EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD

2. Create a virtual environment for the project:
Use the command python -m venv venv (or your system’s equivalent).


3. Activate the virtual environment:
 * On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
 * On Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

4. Install the project’s dependencies:
 * Run pip install -r requirements.txt in the terminal.

5. Run the development server:
 * Use the command python manage.py runserver.

#### Updating Dependencies

If you make changes that require new dependencies:
1. Add the new dependencies to the requirements.txt file by running:
* pip freeze > requirements.txt.
2. Commit and push the updated requirements.txt file to GitHub.


Deployment to Heroku

Setting Up the Heroku App
1. Log in to your Heroku account. If you don’t have one, sign up at Heroku ( https://www.heroku.com/ ).
2. From the Heroku dashboard, click New and select Create New App.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to name your app and choose the appropriate region.

 Configuring Environment Variables
1. In the app’s dashboard, go to the Settings tab.
2. Click Reveal Config Vars and add the following variables:
        •        DATABASE_URL
        •        SECRET_KEY
        •        EMAIL_HOST_USER
        •        EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD

Connecting Heroku to GitHub
1. In the Heroku dashboard for your app, navigate to the Deploy tab.
2. Under Deployment Method, select GitHub.
3. Use the search bar to find and connect your GitHub repository.

Deploying the Application
1. In the Manual Deploy section, select the branch you want to deploy and click Deploy Branch.
2. Alternatively, enable Automatic Deploys so Heroku deploys the app whenever new changes are pushed to the linked branch.

Your application should now be live on Heroku! To view it, click the Open App button in the Heroku dashboard.



<!-- TO-ADD: 
## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.

###  Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
  
###  Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
