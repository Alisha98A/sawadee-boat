### Wireframes

The wireframes included in this project represent the initial design and layout of the core pages of the Sawadee Dining Boat website. These wireframes will serve as a blueprint for the development process, outlining the basic structure, key components, and user interface elements of the site.

By visualizing the flow of the website, the wireframes help to establish a clear, user-friendly experience from the start. They include placeholders for the navigation bar, booking sections, footer, and other essential features that will be developed in later stages. The wireframes will evolve as the project progresses, ensuring the design stays aligned with both user needs and project goals.

<!-- TO-DO: ## Features

👩🏻‍💻 View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Features)

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of. 

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site. -->

### Future Implementations

#### Multiple Languages

To make the site accessible to a broader audience, I plan to implement multi-language support, particularly for international tourists. This will allow users to navigate the site and make bookings in their preferred language, enhancing the overall user experience.

#### Customer Ratings and Reviews
A feedback system will be introduced where customers can rate their experience after their boat trip. This feature will not only help future customers make informed decisions but also provide valuable insights for improving service quality.

#### Waitlist Feature
To prevent potential customers from being turned away due to fully booked slots, a waitlist feature will be added. Customers can join the waitlist for specific time slots and receive automatic notifications if a spot becomes available.

#### Adding More Boats
To scale the business and accommodate more customers, I plan to add additional boats to the fleet. This will allow for greater flexibility in booking and help meet the growing demand as the restaurant gains popularity.

<!-- TO-DO: ### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive. -->
