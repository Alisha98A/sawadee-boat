            <p><strong>Where Thai Cuisine Meets the Beauty of the Sea</strong></p>
            <p>
                Sawadee Dining Boat was founded in 2018 by a group of passionate food lovers and sailors 
                who wanted to offer an unforgettable dining experience. Inspired by the vibrant flavors of 
                Thailand and the serenity of the sea, our restaurant is more than just a meal—it’s a journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                With an authentic Thai menu curated by top chefs, we invite you to enjoy a private 2-hour 
                dining cruise, exploring the stunning waterfront while indulging in delicious, handcrafted dishes.
